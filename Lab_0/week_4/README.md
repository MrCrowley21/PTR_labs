## Week 4
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; This week, the tasks were focused on familiarization with the Supervisor 
specifics provided by the Actor model. \
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Since the Actor model based tasks from week_3 where implemented from 
scratch, it was decided this week to familiarize wit OTP library provided by Elixir. It
easies the process of child creation and supervision, as well as provide some strategies of
children supervison, such as "one_for_one" or "one_for_all".
