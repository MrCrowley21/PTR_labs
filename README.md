## Abstract
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; This repository contains the laboratory works on the RTP subject at TUM. Each laboratory work 
solution can be found in the dedicated map with the corresponding name. Nonetheless, it is planned the implementation 
to be performed in Elixir programming language. \
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The laboratory works are splitted into smaller tasks (based on weeks), oriented to develop a certain skill or 
gain new knowledge in the domain of interest. The discussed tasks are splitted as follows:
* week 1 - Chosen Programming Language instalation and introduction;
* week 2 - Familiarization with the chosen Programming Language.
